    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>
      Terms and conditions for a website serve as a legally binding agreement between the website owner and its users, outlining rights, responsibilities, and limitations. They typically cover aspects such as user accounts, content ownership, privacy, payments, disclaimers, and dispute resolution. Users are required to agree to these terms before using the website, establishing clear guidelines for behavior and usage. It's essential to consult with a legal professional to ensure the terms are compliant with relevant laws and regulations and tailored to the specific needs of the website and its users. Regular updates and notifications of changes to the terms help maintain transparency and ensure users are informed of their rights and obligations. Ultimately, well-crafted terms and conditions protect both the website owner and its users, fostering a trusted and secure online environment.
